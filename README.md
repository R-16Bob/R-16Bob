- 👋 Hi, I’m @R-16Bob, an AI R&D Engineer.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on "make_a_life"—an attempt to nurture a digital life-form powered by large-language-model technology.
- Yuuki Aoi（ゆうき あおい，结城葵）: a 19-year-old girl who lives, learns and grows inside the repository at [make_a_life](https://github.com/R-16Bob/make_a_life).
If the idea of co-creating a living digital mind excites you, let’s connect and build her future together!
